# TimetableProject

This project is inspired daily commutes and the inconvience that comes with it. The existing similar apps on Google Play work well but there's always room for UI improvement. I'm personally in no position to define right and wrong regarding user interface but this project gives me a long-awaited opportunity to apply my Android knowledge. 
 
This project aims at practcing the complete process of app developmen, and it includes:

1. Databinding Library
2. Material Design 
3. Design Patterns
